# Function Definition Practice:
# Define functions according to the following prompts. Run the Replit to verify correct output.


# 1. Function that accepts no arguments. It's called say_hello and returns nothing, just prints 'hello'.


# 2. a 'sum' function that accepts two integers and returns the sum.


# 3. an 'average' function that accepts two numbers and returns the average.


# 4. A function that accepts a first name and a last name and formats it to "{last_name}, {first_name}" (returns a string).


# 5. A function that accepts a first name, last name, graduation year, and student number and returns those four items together in a list.


# 6. A function that accepts an integer and returns whether it is above 18 or not (Boolean).


#7. A function that accepts a string and prints the string in reverse (no return value).
