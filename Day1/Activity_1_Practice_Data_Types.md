# Activity: Practice: Data Types

In this activity, we will practice with the Python data types and methods we have learned thus far! Try to draw comparisons between Python and JavaScript relating to syntax, behaviors, and the advantages that Python provides us.

## Setup

Open [Activity-1-Practice-Data-Types.py](Activity_1_Practice_Data_Types.py) for the starter code.

## Directions

For each section, refer to the instructions in the Replit. Tips in this activity will be helpful if you get stuck.

## Section 1 - Variables and Functions

For the first section, follow the directions in the Replit and refer to the slides if necessary to practice the creation of variables and functions in Python.

- Question 1: Create two variables. One should be a string data type, and the other should be of type int. Use a single print statement to print both variables.
- Question 2: Create a Python function that prints a greeting with a name as the parameter. Invoke the function with a name argument of your choosing.

Tips:

- Remember, in Python you don't need keywords like `let` or `var` to create a variable.
- When writing a function with Python, keep in mind the syntax and indentation requirements.
- Keep in mind the snake_case variable naming convention in Python.

**To ensure a clean working environment, comment out each question and print statement after you create and test it!**

## Section 2 - Lists

For the second section, follow the directions in the Replit and refer to the slides if necessary to practice the creation of lists in Python.

- Question 3: Create a list of your favorite movies with at least 4 elements.
- Question 4: Use a print statement to print the list item at the index of 1.
- Question 5: Append a movie to the end of your list. Use a print statement to print this ammended list.

Tip:

- To append an item to the end of the list, look into the documentation for the list append method.

## Section 3 - Dictionaries

For the third section, follow the directions in the Replit and refer to the slides if necessary to practice the creation of dictionaries in Python.

- Question 6: Create a dictionary named 'cellphone' with 2 key:value pairs that are the properties of your cellphone.
  - The keys should be: "color" and "number".
  - Fill out the values on your own:
- Question 7: Access a value from inside the dictionary (Try to print the value of the 'color' property).

Tip:

- Question 7: To access values inside of a dictionary, we can utilize bracket notation with the corresponding key.

## Section 4 - Strings

For the fourth section, follow the directions in the Replit and refer to the slides if necessary to practice the creation of strings in Python.

- Question 8: Create a variable and store a string with multiple words in it.
- Question 9: Utilize the method that capitalizes the first letter of each word in your string - store this new string in a new variable. Use a print statement to print the new string.

Tip:

- When it comes to manipulating strings, revisit the documentation for Python string methods that offers us many possibilities!

## Bonus

For the bonus section, follow the directions in the Replit and refer to the slides if necessary to practice advanced dictionary syntax in Python. For Question 10, try to relate your knowledge of objects and arrays in JavaScript to your knowledge of dictionaries and lists in Python.

```python
students_in_order =
{
    1: { 'name': 'Esteban', 'age': '27', 'eye color': 'blue'  },
    2: { 'name': 'Jackson', 'age': '22', 'eye color': 'brown' },
    3: { 'name': 'Zayn',    'age': '26', 'eye color': 'green' }
}
```

- Question 10 A: Write a print function that outputs the second student in the dictionary.
- Question 10 B: Write a print statement that outputs the name "Zayn" using the dictionary.
- Question 10 C: Write a print statment that outputs the age of Esteban from the dictionary.

Tips:

- Question 10: Remember that dictionaries are indexed in Python, and the bracket notation approach we saw with lists earlier can be implemented here as well.
- Try your best to take it step by step and isolate the value that you're looking for.
