# Activity: Practice With Basics

This activity continues from where we left off-the Replit will set the stage to practice the syntax and behaviors of sets, tuples, loops, and operators while discovering the advantages of Python's data collections.

## Setup

Open [Activity-2-Practice-With-Basics.py](Activity_2_Practice_With_Basics.py) to gain access to the starter code.

## Directions

For each section, refer to the instructions and tips in the Replit before starting.

**To ensure a clean working environment, comment out each question and print function after you finish and test it!**

## Section 1

For the first section, follow the directions in the Replit and refer to the slides if necessary to practice writing sets and tuples.

For the prequestion, take a look at the JavaScript Array:

```javascript
let javaScriptArray = [12, 55, 33, 40, 55, 33, 20, 12]
```

**How would you remove duplicates from this JavaScript Array?** Take a few minutes to consider what steps are necessary to iterate through this array in JavaScript and remove the duplicate values.

What advantages are available when we're working with Python? If this array was a Python set, we wouldn't be able to store duplicate values in it. Uncomment the identical set in [Activity-2-Practice-With-Basics.py](Activity-2-Practice-With-Basics.py) and run the print statement. What did you notice in the console return?

### Tips 1

- To add an item to our set in Question 1b, use the set.add() method. For more details, [check out this article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/set-add-python/). Are you starting to find a pattern with data types and methods in Python?

## Section 2

For the second section, follow the directions and refer to the slides if necessary to practice loops in Python.

### Tips 2

- Remember the `for-each` loop in Python uses the `for-in` syntax (similar to `for-of` loops in JavaScript). Make sure to [review syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp) and indentation if you get stuck!
- Also, the iterator variable doesn't have to be declared in a `for-each` loop. You can use it in the loop the first time.

## Section 3

For the third section, follow the directions and refer to the slides if necessary to practice conditionals in Python.

### Tips 3

- Look back at the slides or [this resource](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp) to review the syntax for Python conditionals (else, if, elif). Keep in mind that the line breaks and indentations are important.
- For Questions 5a and 5b, make sure that you read the instructions in a literal sense-each keyword points you in the right direction. Feel free to look at the solutions if you feel stuck!
- In Question 6, when practicing with operators in Python, the strict comparison operators are == (equal) or != (not equal). Operators in Python are very close to JavaScript operators. For more information, check out [this resource](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp).

## Bonus

For the bonus, look into [Python Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp) to find the right operators for each question!
