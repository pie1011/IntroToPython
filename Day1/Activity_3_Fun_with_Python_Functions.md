# Activity: Fun with Python Functions

In this activity we are going to practice writing functions in Python. Use the [Activity-3-Fun-with-Python-Functions.py](Activity_3_Fun_with_Python_Functions.py) to get the starter code.

## Python Function Fun Part 1 Prompts

Define functions according to the following prompts. Write code to then call your functions. Run your code to make sure that each function works.

1. A function that accepts no arguments and is named say_hello and returns nothing; it just prints hello.
2. A sum function that accepts two integers and returns the sum.
3. An average function that accepts two numbers and returns the average.
4. A function that accepts a first name and a last name and formats them to "{last_name}, {first_name}" (returns a string).
5. A function that accepts a first name, last name, graduation year, and student number and returns those four items together in a list.
6. A function that accepts an integer and returns whether it is above 18 or not (Boolean).
7. A function that takes a string and prints the string in reverse (no return value).

Remember: to check whether your function behaves correctly, you need to call the function. For example, if you wrote a function called `say_hello()`, you would call it as in the following example. Don't forget to call all of your functions to test that they work correctly.

```python
def say_hello():
    # your code in here

say_hello() # this calls the function
```
