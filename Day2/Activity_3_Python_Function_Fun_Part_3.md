# Activity: Python Function Fun Part 3

In this activity we are going to practice writing functions in Python. The prompts have been listed below. Work may be completed using a personal Replit or a local code editor. Be sure to retain access to your completed work so it can be checked by instructors.

## Python Function Fun: Part 3 Prompts

Please complete the following functions in [Activity_3_Python_Function_Fun_Part_3.py](Activity_3_Python_Function_Fun_Part_3.py).

- `name_args` - Accepts any number of named arguments and prints them in the pattern `key : value` one at a time.
- `all_true` - Returns True if all the elements in an iterable are true. **Hint:** there is an existing built-in function that could be very helpful here.
- `one_true` - Returns True if one of the elements in an iterable is true. Hint: there is an existing built-in function that could be very helpful here.
- `recursive_factorial` - Uses recursion to find the factorial of an integer.
- `recursive_deduplicate` - Recursively removes all adjacent duplicate letters from a string.
  - Input: AABBCCDD
  - Output: ABCD
- `recursive_reverse` - Uses recursion to reverse a string.
