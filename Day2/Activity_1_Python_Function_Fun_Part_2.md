# Activity: Python Function Fun Part 2

In this activity we are going to practice writing functions in Python. The prompts have been listed below. Work may be completed using a personal Replit or a local code editor. Be sure to retain access to your completed work so it can be checked by instructors.

## Python Function Fun: Part 2 Prompts

Please complete the following functions in [Activity_1_Python_Function_Fun_Part_2.py](Activity_1_Python_Function_Fun_Part_2.py).

1. `arb_args` - Takes in any number of arguments and prints them one at a time.
2. `inner_func` - Takes in two integers. Two nested functions should perform separate, distinct math operations using the integers. The result of both nested functions should then be added together and printed.
3. `lunch_lady` - Takes in two strings: a student's name and their lunch preference. The function should print both strings. If a lunch preference is not given, "Mystery Meat" should be printed instead.
4. `sum_n_product` - Accepts two integers and returns both the sum and the product.
5. `alias_arb_args` - Should be arb_args but assigned an alias. Remember, variables can hold functions in Python just like they can in JS. Alternatively, you can call a function from inside another function.
6. `arb_mean` - Accepts any number of integers and prints their average.
7. `arb_longest_string` - Accepts any number of strings and returns the longest one.
